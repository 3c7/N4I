# Cortex Neurons for Infrastructure Analysis (N4I)
A set of neurons (analyzers) for using Cortex as Caching and Rate Limiting instance between infrastructure analysis
scripts and the used services. Currently heavily WIP.  
Uses custom datatypes: 
- censys-ipv4-query
- censys-certificate-query
- shodan-query
- crtsh-query

This set of analyzers provides no ideal output for TheHive, as the results are further progressed in other software.
Also, no templates will be provided - doesn't make sense here.

## Progress
- [ ] Censys
- [ ] Shodan
- [ ] Crt.sh
- [ ] PassiveTotal
